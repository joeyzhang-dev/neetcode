## 🗣️ Interview-Style Walkthrough (CLEAN Format)

### 🔍 1. Clarify and Understand the Problem
> “Rephrase the prompt clearly, confirm assumptions, and ask clarifying questions.”

**✅ Clarified Assumptions:**
- List constraints confirmed during clarification

---

### 🔬 2. Examples & Edge Cases

**Given Example:**  
`"..."` and `"..."` → ✅ True  
...

**Custom Edge Cases:**  
- `("", "")` →  
- `("a", "a")` →  
- Large input edge case →  

---

### 💡 3. Brainstorm Solutions

**Brute Force:**
> “Describe a simple but suboptimal idea to build from.”

- Time: `O(...)`
- Space: `O(...)`
- ✅ When useful: ...

**Optimized Approach:**
> “Describe and justify your best solution.”

- Time: `O(...)`
- Space: `O(...)`

✅ Best for this problem type  
🧠 Mention tradeoffs or other edge case considerations

---

### 🧱 4. Implementation Plan (Talk Through Before Typing)

1. Step-by-step plan
2. Key algorithm logic
3. Data structures used
4. Mapping or helper functions (e.g. `ord()`)

---

### 🧠 5. Code Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(...)`  
- **Space Complexity:** `O(...)`

---

### 🔍 6. Final Review & Wrap-Up

> “Recap solution, edge case coverage, and next steps if needed.”

✅ Confident ending. Always offer test coverage, alternate solutions, or ask the interviewer if they’d like anything expanded.
