## Summary
- Find all unique triplets `[a, b, c]` in the array such that `a + b + c == 0`.
- Sort the array to avoid duplicates and use a **two-pointer approach** to scan for valid pairs after fixing the first number.
- This method avoids duplicates and achieves `O(n^2)` time with constant space.

**Best Solution:** Two-Pointer with Sorted Input  
- After sorting, fix one number `a`, then scan the rest using two pointers to find `b + c = -a`.

## [15. 3Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/)
**Precondition:**  
- `3 <= len(nums) <= 3000`  
- `-10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`  
- Output must not contain duplicate triplets

> 💡 Fix one number, then use two pointers to find two others that sum to its inverse. Sort to enable duplicate skipping and efficient scanning.

### Approach 1: Brute Force with Deduplication
**Time Complexity:** `O(n^3)`  
**Space Complexity:** `O(n)` (due to result set and conversions)  
**Idea:**  
Check every triplet using three nested loops. To avoid duplicates:
- Sort input to avoid permutations/repeats slipping in
- Use a set of tuples to store unique triplets. Sets no permutation duplicates
- Convert back to list of lists before returning.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def threeSum(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: List[List[int]]
        """
        # Brute Force: Check all triplets (i, j, k)
        # Sort nums to normalize permutations
        # Use set to store unique tuples only

        result = set()
        nums.sort()

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):
                for k in range(j+1, len(nums)):
                    if nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0:
                        temp = [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]
                        result.add(tuple(temp))  # must be hashable for set

        return [list(i) for i in result]  # convert back to list
```

> 🧠 Works but very slow for large inputs. Ideal for verifying correctness and edge behavior before optimizing.

### Approach 2: Hash Map + Count Management
**Time Complexity:** `O(n^2)`  
**Space Complexity:** `O(n)`  
**Idea:**  
- Sort the input array.
- Build a hash map (`defaultdict`) to store the count of each number.
- For every pair `(i, j)`, check if the remaining number `target = -(nums[i] + nums[j])` still exists (has count > 0).
- Carefully update and restore counts to avoid reusing values already fixed.

```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        nums.sort()
        count = defaultdict(int)
        for num in nums:
            count[num] += 1

        res = []
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            count[nums[i]] -= 1
            if i and nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:
                continue  # skip duplicate i

            for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
                count[nums[j]] -= 1
                if j - 1 > i and nums[j] == nums[j - 1]:
                    continue  # skip duplicate j

                target = -(nums[i] + nums[j])
                if count[target] > 0:
                    res.append([nums[i], nums[j], target])

            # restore counts for j before next i
            for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
                count[nums[j]] += 1

        return res
```

> 🧠 Uses hash map lookup to reduce third-value search to O(1), while managing duplicates carefully by skipping repeated elements and updating the count dictionary.

### Approach 3 (BEST): Two-Pointer Scan (Sorted)
**Time Complexity:** `O(n^2)`  
**Space Complexity:** `O(1)` (ignoring output)  
**Idea:**  
- Sort the array first to bring duplicates together and enable pointer logic.
- Iterate with index `i`, fixing `nums[i]` as the first value `a`.
- For each `a`, use two pointers `l` and `r` to find two numbers such that `a + nums[l] + nums[r] == 0`.
- Skip duplicates of `a` and `nums[l]` to avoid repeated triplets.

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = []
        nums.sort()  # Sort to enable two-pointer pattern and deduplication

        for i, a in enumerate(nums):
            if a > 0:
                break  # Early exit: since array is sorted, any sum will be > 0 from here on

            if i > 0 and a == nums[i - 1]:
                continue  # Skip duplicate `a` values to avoid repeating triplets

            l, r = i + 1, len(nums) - 1  # Two pointers for the remaining subarray
            while l < r:
                threeSum = a + nums[l] + nums[r]

                if threeSum > 0:
                    r -= 1  # Too large → move right pointer left
                elif threeSum < 0:
                    l += 1  # Too small → move left pointer right
                else:
                    res.append([a, nums[l], nums[r]])  # Valid triplet found
                    l += 1
                    r -= 1

                    # Skip duplicate `b` values to avoid repeated triplets like [-1,0,1], [-1,0,1]
                    while l < r and nums[l] == nums[l - 1]:
                        l += 1

        return res
```

> 🧠 This is the cleanest and most efficient approach.  
> Sorting enables early exit and easy deduplication, while the two-pointer scan keeps time complexity at `O(n^2)` and space constant. Ideal for interviews and large inputs alike.

## 🗣️ Interview-Style Walkthrough (CLEAN Format)

### 🔍 1. Clarify and Understand the Problem

> “We need to find all unique triplets in the input array that sum to zero. The output must not contain duplicate triplets.”

**✅ Clarified Assumptions:**
- Input size: `3 <= len(nums) <= 3000`
- Elements range from `-10^5` to `10^5`
- Output triplets should not repeat, even in different orders
- Order inside each triplet doesn’t matter (e.g., `[−1,0,1]` is the same as `[1,−1,0]`)
- Must return all *distinct* valid triplets

---

### 🔬 2. Examples & Edge Cases

**Given Example:**  
`nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]`  
→ After sorting: `[-4, -1, -1, 0, 1, 2]`  
→ Output: `[[-1, -1, 2], [-1, 0, 1]]`

**Edge Cases to Consider:**

- ✅ All positive numbers → no solution  
  Example: `[1, 2, 3]` → `[]`
- ✅ All negative numbers → no solution  
  Example: `[-5, -4, -3]` → `[]`
- ✅ Duplicates that could form valid triplets → should return only **unique** ones  
  Example: `[-2,0,0,2,2]` → `[[-2,0,2]]`
- ✅ Multiple zeros  
  Example: `[0, 0, 0]` → `[[0, 0, 0]]`
- ✅ Large arrays with many duplicates

---

### 💡 3. Brainstorm Solutions

**Brute Force:**  
Try all `O(n^3)` combinations of 3 numbers.

- ✅ Easy to understand
- ❌ Too slow for large input
- ❌ Difficult to deduplicate cleanly

**HashMap + Count:**  
Use frequency map and manage counts.

- ✅ Smarter lookup for third number
- ❌ More complex logic
- ❌ Extra space needed

**✅ Optimized: Two Pointers After Sorting**  
> Fix `nums[i]`, then scan the rest of the array using left/right pointers to find pairs that sum to `-nums[i]`.

- ✅ Time: `O(n^2)`
- ✅ Space: `O(1)` (not counting output)
- ✅ Duplicates easily handled via sorting and pointer skip logic
- ✅ Clean, easy to explain in an interview

---

### 🧱 4. Implementation Plan (Talk Through Before Typing)

1. **Sort** the input array to group duplicates and allow pointer logic.
2. **Loop through the array with index `i`**:
   - Skip if `nums[i] == nums[i - 1]` to avoid duplicate triplets.
   - Break early if `nums[i] > 0` since further numbers will only increase the sum.
3. **Initialize two pointers** `l = i + 1`, `r = end`.
4. While `l < r`:
   - Compute `threeSum = nums[i] + nums[l] + nums[r]`
   - If sum > 0: move `r--` (too large)
   - If sum < 0: move `l++` (too small)
   - If sum == 0:
     - Store the triplet
     - Move both pointers
     - Skip duplicate values on the left with `while nums[l] == nums[l - 1]`
5. Return the collected results

### 💻 Full Code with Commentary

```python
def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
```

> “I’ll define a function that returns all unique triplets that sum to zero.”

```python
    res = []
    nums.sort()
```

> “First, I sort the array. This is crucial because it allows me to efficiently skip duplicates and use two pointers to scan for valid pairs.”

```python
    for i, a in enumerate(nums):
```

> “I’ll loop through the array using `i` to fix the first number of the triplet, which I’ll call `a`.”

```python
        if a > 0:
            break
```

> “Since the array is sorted, if `a` becomes positive, there’s no way to get a sum of zero — so I can exit early.”

```python
        if i > 0 and a == nums[i - 1]:
            continue
```

> “I’ll also skip duplicate values of `a`. If I’ve already processed this number in a previous iteration, I don’t want to redo work or produce duplicate triplets.”

```python
        l, r = i + 1, len(nums) - 1
```

> “I initialize two pointers — one starting right after `i`, and the other at the end of the array. I’ll scan for two numbers that add with `a` to zero.”

```python
        while l < r:
```

> “While the pointers haven’t crossed, I’ll keep checking combinations.”

```python
            threeSum = a + nums[l] + nums[r]
```

> “This is the total sum of the triplet: the anchor `a` and the values at `l` and `r`.”

```python
            if threeSum > 0:
                r -= 1
```

> “If the sum is too large, I move the right pointer left to decrease the sum.”

```python
            elif threeSum < 0:
                l += 1
```

> “If the sum is too small, I move the left pointer right to increase the sum.”

```python
            else:
                res.append([a, nums[l], nums[r]])
```

> “If the sum is exactly zero, I’ve found a valid triplet and add it to the result list.”

```python
                l += 1
                r -= 1
```

> “Then I move both pointers inward to look for the next potential match.”

```python
                while l < r and nums[l] == nums[l - 1]:
                    l += 1
```

> “This part is crucial: I skip over any duplicate values on the left so I don’t repeat the same triplet again.”

```python
    return res
```

> “Finally, I return the list of all unique triplets I found.”

### 🧠 Recap Talking Points

- “I sorted the array to group duplicates and enable two-pointer scanning.”
- “For each index `i`, I fix one value and use two pointers to search for the remaining two.”
- “I skip over duplicate values at `i` and `l` to avoid repeating triplets.”
- “This runs in `O(n^2)` time and uses constant space, making it optimal for the problem.”
- “It generalizes well into the `k-Sum` family of problems, including 4Sum.”

---

### 🧠 5. Code Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n^2)`
  - Outer loop runs `n` times
  - Inner two-pointer loop runs up to `n` times per outer iteration
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`
  - We use no extra data structures besides the output

✅ Deduplication is handled efficiently  
✅ Sorting adds `O(n log n)` but is dominated by `O(n^2)` two-pointer loop  
✅ No hash maps or extra memory needed
